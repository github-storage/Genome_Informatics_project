In this repo are stored calculation scripts used as part of project for Genomics Informatics course.

snp_metrics.ipynb is currently our finall script. Other two are similiar and they are represent previous versions of our final script.

### Task

* Objective of our project was to perform Variant calling on provided BAM file and using human genome as reference genome (fasta file) by using GATK 4 Haplotype Caller and Free Bayes variant calling tools.

* 2nd tasks was to compare output files from previous step taking Halpotype Caller as truth set and Freebayes as test set and getting out various metrics from that comparison like True positives, False positivises, False negatives and also calculate precision recall and F-score metrics.
